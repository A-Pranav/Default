We took part in The Great India Hackathon hosted at Chitkara University and Reskill.

*We have used Motion Detection using camera and opencv`*

*It currently uses a feature of detecting the number of person currently in frame.`*

*Special case- If personâ€™s face is covered then the camera will detect the eyes the person to start the recording of the footage.`*

# Advantages over CCTV
*It enhances security.*

*It has better performance results over normal cctv cameras installed at the location.*

*Unlike cctv this motion detector only capture the video if the face of the entity is visible.*

*This make our system use less space.*
